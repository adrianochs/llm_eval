    "\n",
    "*Goal:* \n",
    "- run tests whenever you commit changes to your code base. \n",
    "- Combine per-commit and pre-release evals.\n",
    "- detect hallcinations in LLM responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Rule-based evals\n",
    "- Use string or pattern matching. E.g. regulat expression matching.\n",
    "- Use whenever you evaluate outputs with a clear right answer, e.g. sentiment classification where you have ground trouth labels.\n",
    "- Fast and cheap to run - good to run per-commit.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Model graded evals\n",
    "- Whenever there are many possible good or bad outputs, e.g. LLM writing text content for you there are potenitally many high quality responses.\n",
    "- You use an evaluation LLM to evaluate your application LLM.\n",
    "- More expansive to run - good fro pre-release."
